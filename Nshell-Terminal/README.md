# Nshell-Terminal
NShell is a custom terminal shell built in C# using .NET. It offers a Unix-like command-line experience with built-in commands for navigation, file management, and networking. NShell supports command aliases, input history with arrow-key navigation, and is designed as an experimental learning project for shell architecture and command parsing.
